    Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, meaning Royal Madrid Football Club, commonly referred to as
    Real Madrid or simply Real, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid.
    Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since 
    its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King 
    Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. Real Madrid have played their home 
    matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most 
    European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout 
    its history.
    Real Madrid is one of the most widely supported teams internationally. The club was estimated to be 
    worth $5.1 billion in 2022, making it the world's most valuable football team. In 2021, it was the 
    second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €640.7 million.
    Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the 
    top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid 
    holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño 
    with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European 
    football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and 
    reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid 
    winning twelve league titles in the span of 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, 
    Ferenc Puskás, Francisco Gento, and Raymond Kopa, is considered by some in the sport to be the 
    greatest of all time.

    Real Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the Goal! football movie trilogy, 
    Goal! 2: Living the Dream... (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez 
    as he is first scouted, and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted 
    to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the 
    full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid 
    squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, 
    Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, 
    Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, 
    Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and 
    Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional 
    player Muñez to the club after his signing.
    Real, The Movie is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion 
    for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of 
    fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the 
    film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, 
    and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on galácticos such 
    as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas, and Roberto Carlos, 
    among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide 
    fanbase.
    The book White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid by Phil Ball was the first English-language history 
    of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during 
    its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid 
    released a digital music album, entitled Legends, and a remix of the club's 
    anthem, "Himno del Real Madrid," was released as the first single from the album.
